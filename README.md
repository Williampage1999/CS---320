How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?  --  
  A great way to ensure the quality of your code is by implemting test within your application that test specific requirments based on what you are trying to accomplish. We did this in project One with the JUnit test.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?  --  
  One way is to gather the requirements that they provide or by also asking them there outlook for how the application should look and then setting up a list of the requirments and how to implement them.


How do I approach designing software?  --  
  Designing software should be approached by first gathering the necessary requirements and implmentations of the desired applications and then formulating a plan on how they should be implmented into the application.
